# Goals for .NET Console App Template

## Objective
Create a .NET template for a console application that incorporates:
1. Dependency Injection
2. .NET Hosting Model
3. System.CommandLine

## Key Features
1. **Dependency Injection**
    - Utilize Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
    - Set up a service container for managing dependencies
    - Demonstrate injection of services into the main application and commands

2. **.NET Hosting Model**
    - Implement IHostBuilder for application configuration
    - Set up dependency injection, logging, and configuration as part of the host

3. **System.CommandLine**
    - Integrate System.CommandLine for parsing command-line arguments
    - Define command structure with options and arguments
    - Bind command-line inputs to strongly-typed objects

## Benefits
- Modular and maintainable code structure
- Easier unit testing through dependency injection
- Consistent configuration and logging setup
- Robust command-line argument parsing and validation

## Next Steps
1. Set up the basic project structure
2. Implement the hosting model
3. Add dependency injection
4. Integrate System.CommandLine
5. Create example commands and services
6. Document usage and customization instructions
