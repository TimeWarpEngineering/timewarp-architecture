# Task 001: Set Up Project Structure

## Description

Create the initial project structure for the .NET 8 console app template. This will serve as the foundation for integrating Dependency Injection, Hosting, and System.CommandLine in subsequent tasks.

## Requirements

- Create a new console application project targeting **.NET 8.0**.
- Organize project files and folders logically (e.g., `src`, `tests`, `docs`).
- Ensure the project builds and runs successfully.
- Prepare the project for transformation into a reusable template.

## Checklist

- [ ] **Initialize Project**
    - [ ] Use `dotnet new console --framework net8.0` to create the project.
    - [ ] Verify the project targets .NET 8.0 in the `.csproj` file.
- [ ] **Organize Structure**
    - [ ] Create appropriate folders: `src` for source code, `tests` for unit tests, `docs` for documentation.
    - [ ] Add a `.gitignore` file tailored for .NET projects.
- [ ] **Verify Build**
    - [ ] Build the project to ensure there are no errors.
    - [ ] Run the default application to confirm it executes successfully.
- [ ] **Prepare for Template Conversion**
    - [ ] Add essential project metadata and placeholders as needed.
    - [ ] Ensure no hard-coded values that would hinder templating.
- [ ] **Documentation**
    - [ ] Create a `README.md` with initial project information and instructions.
    - [ ] Document the project structure and its purpose.

## Notes

- **Attention to Detail**: This task lays the groundwork for the entire project; ensure all configurations are correct.
- **Consistency**: Adhere to standard conventions to facilitate ease of use when the project is converted into a template.
- **Future Integration**: Keep the code minimal and clean to simplify the addition of features in future tasks.

## Implementation Notes

- Consider using the `dotnet new gitignore` command to generate a standard `.gitignore` file.
- Avoid adding unnecessary packages or code at this stage.
- Document any decisions that deviate from typical project setups and provide reasons.
