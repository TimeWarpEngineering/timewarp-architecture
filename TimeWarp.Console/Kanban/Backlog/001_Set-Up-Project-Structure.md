# Task 001: Set Up Project Structure

## Description

- Create the initial project structure for the .NET 8 console app template.
- Ensure the project is configured to serve as a reusable template.
- Establish a solid foundation for integrating Dependency Injection, Hosting, and System.CommandLine in subsequent tasks.

## Requirements

- Create a new console application project targeting .NET 8.0.
- Organize the project files and folders logically to support future enhancements.
- Ensure the project builds and runs successfully.
- Prepare the project to be transformed into a template in later steps.

## Checklist

> Add relevant items to the checklist as necessary when creating the task or implementing it.

### Design

- [ ] Create a new .NET 8.0 console application project.
- [ ] Set up a logical folder structure (e.g., `Source`, `Tests`, `Documentation`).
- [ ] Include a `.gitignore` file tailored for .NET projects.
- [ ] Add essential project metadata in the `.csproj` file.

### Implementation

- [ ] Update project dependencies to target .NET 8.0.
- [ ] Verify that the project builds without errors.
- [ ] Run the default application to ensure it executes successfully.
- [ ] Set up initial configuration files if necessary (e.g., `appsettings.json`).

### Documentation

- [ ] Create a `README.md` with initial project information.
- [ ] Document the project structure and purpose.
- [ ] Update `.ai` files with relevant information.

### Review

- [ ] Consider accessibility implications.
- [ ] Consider monitoring and alerting implications.
- [ ] Consider performance implications.
- [ ] Consider security implications.
- [ ] Perform a code review to ensure best practices are followed.

## Notes

- This task establishes the groundwork for the entire project; attention to detail is crucial.
- Ensure that the project adheres to standard conventions to facilitate ease of use when transformed into a template.
- No dependencies on previous .NET versions should exist; confirm all references are compatible with .NET 8.0.

## Implementation Notes

- While setting up the project, consider using the `dotnet new console` command with the `--framework net8.0` option to target .NET 8.0 explicitly.
- Keep the initial code as minimal as possible since additional features will be added in subsequent tasks.
- Document any deviations from standard practices and justify the reasons for them.
