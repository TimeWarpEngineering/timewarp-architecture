# ADR-001: Region Naming and Usage in Entity Classes

* Status: proposed
* Deciders: Architect
* Consulted: Amina
* Date: 2024-03-05

## Context

In our object-oriented design, we have various types of associations between entities, including Composite, Aggregate, and Normal associations. These associations can be represented in code using properties, but without clear organization, the code can become difficult to understand and maintain.

To enhance code readability and maintainability, we propose using named regions to group properties based on their association types.

## Decision

We will define three named regions within our Entity classes to group properties according to their association types:

1. **Composite-Associations (Filled Diamond)**: This region will contain properties that represent composite associations, where the entity is part of another entity, and there is a strong "whole-part" relationship.

2. **Aggregate-Associations (Unfilled Diamond)**: This region will contain properties that represent aggregate associations, where the entity can be owned by one of several possible aggregate associations. Only one of these associations will be populated at a time.

3. **Normal-Associations (No Diamond)**: This region will contain properties that represent normal associations, where there is a relationship between entities, but no ownership is implied.

### Example Usage

\`\`\`csharp
public class Part
{
    #region Composite-Associations (Filled Diamond)
    // Properties for composite associations
    #endregion

    #region Aggregate-Associations (Unfilled Diamond)
    public Car Car { get; set; }
    public Bike Bike { get; set; }
    #endregion

    #region Normal-Associations (No Diamond)
    // Properties for normal associations
    #endregion
}
\`\`\`

## Consequences

- **Pros**:
  - **Readability**: By grouping properties into named regions, the code becomes more organized and easier to read.
  - **Maintainability**: Clear separation of different types of associations simplifies maintenance and reduces the risk of errors.
  - **Alignment with UML**: The naming convention aligns with standard UML terminology, providing a familiar framework for developers.

- **Cons**:
  - **Potential Overhead**: Developers must be aware of the naming convention and adhere to it, which may require training or documentation.
