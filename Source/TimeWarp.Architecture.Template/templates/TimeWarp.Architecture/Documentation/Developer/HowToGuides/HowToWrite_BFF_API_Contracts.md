# How to Build Your BFF API Contracts

## Introduction

This guide is tailored for designing API contracts within the TimeWarp Architecture, where the backend-for-frontend (BFF) approach empowers UX designers to dictate the structure of API contracts, which will be implemented by the API. This BFF strategy ensures that the APIs are optimized for the specific use cases and workflows of the frontend, streamlining development. This document provides a concise roadmap for creating these API contracts, ensuring they are functional, efficient, and aligned with the frontend needs.

## 1. Define Your Data Models

### Key Principles

- **Clarity and Simplicity**: Ensure your data models are easy to understand and use.
- **Consistency**: Use consistent naming and data types across your API to reduce confusion.

### Example

```csharp
public class UserDetails
{
public int UserId { get; init; }
public string FirstName { get; set; }
public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

## 2. Choose the Right Data Structures

### Immutability vs. Mutability

- **Immutable Objects**: Use when you want to ensure the object cannot be modified after creation. This is crucial for maintaining state integrity across distributed systems.
- **Mutable Objects**: Use when the object needs to be updated, such as in CRUD operations.

### Example

```csharp
public interface IUserDetails
{
int UserId { get; init; }
string FirstName { get; set; }
}
```

## 3. Implementing Interfaces for Flexibility

### Benefits of Interfaces

- **Flexibility**: Interfaces allow for multiple implementations and easier modifications of the API.
- **Abstraction**: They abstract implementation details, focusing on what operations are possible rather than how they are performed.

### Example

```csharp
public interface IUserDetails
{
int UserId { get; }
string FirstName { get; }
string LastName { get; }
}
```

## 4. Handling Collections

### Mutable vs. Immutable Collections

- **Use \`IReadOnlyList<T>\`: When exposing data that should not be modified by the consumer.
- **Use \`List<T>\` internally**: To maintain flexibility within the service layer.

### Example

```csharp
public class UserDetails : IUserDetails
{
private List<string> _roles = new List<string>();
public IReadOnlyList<string> Roles => _roles.AsReadOnly();
}
```

## 5. Documenting API Contracts

### Importance of Documentation

- **Transparency**: Clear documentation ensures that all parties understand the APIâ€™s capabilities and limitations.
- **Ease of Use**: Well-documented APIs are easier to integrate and use effectively.

### Tools and Practices

- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Use tools like Swagger to automatically generate documentation and provide interactive API explorers.
- **Comments and Examples**: Include comments and usage examples in your code to clarify how the API should be used.

## Conclusion

Building effective API contracts requires careful consideration of the data models, structures, and the communication between components. By following best practices such as using interfaces and choosing appropriate data structures, you can create robust and flexible APIs that are easy to manage and evolve.
