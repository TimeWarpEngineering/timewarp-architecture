# 029: Create Directory Naming Convention Analysis Report

## Description

Conduct a comprehensive analysis of directory naming conventions across the TimeWarp.Architecture project to identify patterns, inconsistencies, and establish standardized directory naming guidelines. This complements the file naming analysis (Task 025) by focusing specifically on folder structure and directory organization.

## Requirements

- Analyze directory naming patterns across the entire project structure
- Document technology-specific directory conventions (.NET, web, infrastructure)
- Identify inconsistencies in directory naming approaches
- Create comprehensive directory naming guidelines
- Provide recommendations for standardization

## Checklist

### Analysis Scope
- [ ] **Project Structure Directories**: Analyze main project organization (Source/, Tests/, ContainerApps/, etc.)
- [ ] **.NET Project Directories**: Examine layer-based directory structure (Application/, Domain/, Infrastructure/, etc.)
- [ ] **Web Asset Directories**: Analyze frontend directory organization (Components/, Pages/, Features/, etc.)
- [ ] **Infrastructure Directories**: Review DevOps, Kubernetes, Docker folder structures
- [ ] **Documentation Directories**: Examine docs organization (Developer/, Conceptual/, HowToGuides/, etc.)
- [ ] **Test Directories**: Analyze test project organization and naming patterns
- [ ] **Kanban Directories**: Review task management folder structure

### Directory Naming Pattern Analysis
- [ ] **Case Conventions**: Document PascalCase vs camelCase vs kebab-case vs snake_case usage
- [ ] **Multi-word Handling**: Analyze how compound directory names are structured
- [ ] **Technology Alignment**: Compare .NET conventions vs web conventions vs infrastructure patterns
- [ ] **Hierarchy Depth**: Examine directory nesting patterns and depth limits
- [ ] **Special Characters**: Document use of hyphens, underscores, periods in directory names

### Specific Areas to Investigate
- [ ] **Microservice Structure**: ContainerApps organization (Api/, Web/, Grpc/, Aspire/, Yarp/)
- [ ] **Layer Architecture**: Common project layering (Application/, Contracts/, Domain/, Infrastructure/, Server/)
- [ ] **Feature Organization**: How features are organized within projects
- [ ] **Test Organization**: Test project directory structures and naming
- [ ] **DevOps Structure**: Infrastructure-as-code directory organization
- [ ] **Documentation Hierarchy**: Technical documentation folder structure

### Inconsistency Identification
- [ ] **Mixed Case Usage**: Find directories using different case conventions
- [ ] **Inconsistent Separators**: Identify mixed use of hyphens, underscores, etc.
- [ ] **Technology Conflicts**: Areas where .NET and web conventions clash
- [ ] **Naming Ambiguity**: Directories with unclear or inconsistent purposes
- [ ] **Hierarchy Issues**: Inconsistent nesting patterns or depth

### Compliance Assessment
- [ ] **Rate consistency** across different technology stacks
- [ ] **Identify exemplary areas** with excellent directory organization
- [ ] **Document problem areas** requiring standardization
- [ ] **Assess impact** of potential directory renames

### Report Generation
- [ ] **Executive Summary**: Overall directory naming compliance and key findings
- [ ] **Technology-Specific Analysis**: Detailed breakdown by tech stack
- [ ] **Pattern Documentation**: Catalog all directory naming patterns found
- [ ] **Inconsistency Map**: Specific directories requiring attention
- [ ] **Recommendations**: Proposed standardized directory conventions
- [ ] **Migration Impact**: Assessment of changes needed for consistency

## Deliverables

1. **Directory-Naming-Convention-Analysis-Report.md**: Comprehensive analysis report
2. **Directory naming patterns documentation**: Catalog of current conventions
3. **Standardization recommendations**: Proposed directory naming guidelines
4. **Migration roadmap**: Plan for achieving directory naming consistency

## Notes

This analysis will address the gap left by Task 025, which focused on file naming but didn't comprehensively cover directory structure conventions. Directory naming is critical for:

- **Code organization**: Clear hierarchy and logical grouping
- **Developer experience**: Intuitive navigation and discoverability  
- **Build systems**: Consistent paths for automation and tooling
- **IDE integration**: Proper project structure recognition
- **Documentation**: Clear reference to code organization

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- Should directories follow PascalCase like C# namespaces, or web-style lowercase?
- How should multi-word directory names be handled (hyphens vs underscores)?
- What's the optimal directory hierarchy depth for different areas?
- How should feature-based organization be structured?
- Should infrastructure directories follow different conventions?
