# 008_Create-FastEndpointSourceGenerator-Tests

## Description

Create comprehensive test cases to exercise and validate all features of the FastEndpointSourceGenerator. This will ensure the source generator correctly handles various endpoint configurations and generates appropriate code.

## Requirements

1. Create test cases for all FastEndpointSourceGenerator features:
   - Route and HTTP verb generation from RouteMixin attribute
   - Documentation generation (Summary and Description)
   - Authorization requirements
   - Custom endpoint type support
   - Tag generation (from namespace and OpenApiTags)
   - Error handling and diagnostics
   - Route conflict detection

2. Test edge cases and error conditions:
   - Missing or invalid attributes
   - Conflicting routes
   - Invalid route templates
   - Missing documentation
   - Invalid namespace structures

3. Verify generated code:
   - Correct endpoint class generation
   - Proper inheritance from base classes
   - Accurate route configuration
   - Correct HTTP verb methods
   - Documentation comments
   - Authorization settings
   - OpenAPI/Swagger integration

## Checklist

### Design
- [ ] Create test plan covering all features
- [ ] Design test endpoint classes with various configurations
- [ ] Plan edge cases and error scenarios

### Implementation
- [ ] Create base test infrastructure
- [ ] Implement positive test cases for each feature:
  - [ ] Basic endpoint generation
  - [ ] Route and HTTP verb handling
  - [ ] Documentation generation
  - [ ] Authorization requirements
  - [ ] Custom endpoint types
  - [ ] Tag generation
- [ ] Implement negative test cases:
  - [ ] Error handling
  - [ ] Route conflicts
  - [ ] Invalid configurations
- [ ] Add verification helpers for generated code

### Documentation
- [ ] Document test approach and coverage
- [ ] Add comments explaining test scenarios
- [ ] Update FastEndpointSourceGenerator.md with test examples

### Review
- [ ] Verify test coverage is comprehensive
- [ ] Ensure all edge cases are covered
- [ ] Review test readability and maintainability
- [ ] Validate error handling coverage

## Notes

Test cases should be organized by feature to maintain clarity and make it easy to add new tests as the source generator evolves.

Key test scenarios:
1. Basic endpoint with minimal configuration
2. Endpoint with full documentation
3. Authorized endpoint with custom base type
4. Endpoint with multiple tags
5. Endpoints with potential route conflicts
6. Invalid configurations that should fail gracefully

## Implementation Notes

The test implementation should follow these principles:
1. Use a consistent naming convention for test classes
2. Group related test cases together
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Verify both the generated code structure and runtime behavior
5. Add detailed failure messages for easier debugging
