# 027: Create File Naming Convention ADR And Documentation

## Description

Create a comprehensive Architectural Decision Record (ADR) for file naming conventions and update associated documentation to establish standardized patterns across the TimeWarp.Architecture project.

## Parent

025_Create-File-Naming-Convention-Analysis-Report

## Requirements

- Create ADR documenting all established file naming patterns
- Include technology-specific conventions for each file type
- Provide clear examples for each naming pattern
- Update Task Template with naming convention guidelines
- Document infrastructure naming standards

## Checklist

### ADR Creation
- [ ] Create ADR-0007 (or next available number) for file naming conventions
- [ ] Document C# source file naming patterns (PascalCase.cs)
- [ ] Document Razor component naming patterns (PascalCase.razor, Parent_Child.razor)
- [ ] Document configuration file patterns (lowercase.json, .dotfile.js)
- [ ] Document infrastructure file patterns (bicep, kubernetes, powershell)
- [ ] Document Kanban task file patterns (###_Title-With-Hyphens.md)
- [ ] Include technology-specific examples for each category

### Task Template Updates
- [ ] Add naming convention guidelines section to Task-Template.md
- [ ] Include examples of proper task naming
- [ ] Document sub-task numbering rules (###_###_ pattern)
- [ ] Add folder vs single file decision criteria

### Infrastructure Standards Documentation
- [ ] Clarify Kubernetes YAML naming conventions (snake_case + hyphens)
- [ ] Document when to use snake_case vs kebab-case
- [ ] Standardize multi-word file handling across technologies
- [ ] Create examples for Bicep file naming

### Integration with Existing ADRs
- [ ] Reference ADR-0006 (Kanban process) for task naming
- [ ] Cross-reference with branch naming conventions (ADR-0004)
- [ ] Ensure consistency with existing architectural decisions

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files that reference naming patterns
- [ ] Add links to new ADR from appropriate locations
- [ ] Verify all examples follow established conventions

## Notes

This is Phase 2 of the Implementation Timeline from the file naming convention analysis. Estimated completion time: 2 days.

**Builds on**: Task 026 (critical fixes should be completed first)

**Benefits**: 
- Establishes official naming standards for future development
- Provides clear guidance for developers and AI assistants
- Ensures consistency across all file types and technologies
