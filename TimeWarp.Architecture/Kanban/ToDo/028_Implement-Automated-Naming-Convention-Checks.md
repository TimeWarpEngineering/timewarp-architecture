# 028: Implement Automated Naming Convention Checks

## Description

Implement automated validation and checks for file naming conventions to prevent future inconsistencies and maintain high compliance rates across the TimeWarp.Architecture project.

## Parent

025_Create-File-Naming-Convention-Analysis-Report

## Requirements

- Create pre-commit hooks for task naming validation
- Add naming convention tests to CI/CD pipeline
- Implement task number uniqueness validation
- Create migration scripts for future file renames
- Establish monitoring for naming convention compliance

## Checklist

### Pre-commit Hooks
- [ ] Create PowerShell script to validate Kanban task naming patterns
- [ ] Implement PascalCase validation for task titles
- [ ] Add task number uniqueness checking
- [ ] Validate proper ###_Title-With-Hyphens.md format
- [ ] Check for duplicate task numbers across all Kanban folders
- [ ] Integrate with git pre-commit hooks

### CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Add naming convention tests to GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Create automated checks for C# file naming (PascalCase.cs)
- [ ] Validate Razor component naming patterns
- [ ] Check infrastructure file naming compliance
- [ ] Generate compliance reports on each build

### Migration and Maintenance Scripts
- [ ] Create PowerShell script to rename non-compliant files
- [ ] Implement Git history preservation during renames (`git mv`)
- [ ] Add script to update all references to renamed files
- [ ] Create task number conflict resolution script
- [ ] Develop bulk naming pattern correction tools

### Validation Rules Implementation
- [ ] C# files: Strict PascalCase validation
- [ ] Razor components: PascalCase with underscore sub-components
- [ ] Configuration files: Technology-appropriate casing
- [ ] Kanban tasks: PascalCase titles with hyphen separators
- [ ] Infrastructure files: Documented standard compliance

### Monitoring and Reporting
- [ ] Create compliance dashboard/report generation
- [ ] Implement metrics collection for naming consistency
- [ ] Add alerts for naming convention violations
- [ ] Generate periodic compliance assessment reports

### Documentation
- [ ] Document how to use validation scripts
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for naming issues
- [ ] Document CI/CD integration setup
- [ ] Provide examples of automated fixes

## Notes

This is Phase 3 of the Implementation Timeline from the file naming convention analysis. Estimated completion time: 3 days.

**Dependencies**: 
- Task 026 (critical fixes) should be completed first
- Task 027 (ADR documentation) provides the standards to validate against

**Benefits**:
- Prevents future naming inconsistencies
- Maintains 99%+ compliance rate automatically
- Reduces manual review overhead
- Provides immediate feedback to developers

**Technical Considerations**:
- Scripts should be cross-platform compatible (PowerShell Core)
- CI/CD checks should be fast and non-blocking for valid names
- Migration scripts must preserve git history
- Validation rules should be configurable and extensible
