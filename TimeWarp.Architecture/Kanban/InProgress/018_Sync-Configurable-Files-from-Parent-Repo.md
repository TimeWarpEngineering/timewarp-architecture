# Task 018: Sync Configurable Files from Parent Repo

## Description

Add a workflow item for child repositories to check for updates in configurable files from a parent repository. This task involves setting up a GitHub Actions workflow in child repos with a cron job to periodically poll the parent repo for updates and automatically create pull requests (PRs) in the child repos to apply those updates. The goal is to ensure that when a template or configuration file is updated in the parent repo, the child repos can sync those updates to maintain consistency.

## Requirements

- Create a GitHub Actions workflow file that runs on a schedule (cron job) and can be manually triggered to check for updates in the parent repository.
- Implement logic to compare configurable files between the parent and child repos.
- Automate the creation of PRs in child repos when updates are detected in the parent repo.
- Ensure the workflow is configurable to support different sets of files to sync.

## Checklist

### Design
- [ ] Update Model (if applicable for any data structures related to configuration tracking)
- [ ] Add/Update Tests for the workflow logic if scripted

### Implementation
- [ ] Update Dependencies (if any new tools or libraries are needed for the workflow)
- [ ] Update Relevant Configuration Settings for GitHub Actions
- [ ] Verify Functionality of the cron job and PR creation process
- [ ] add .gitignore and .editorconfig files to the sync configuration.

### Documentation
- [ ] Update Documentation to explain the sync workflow and how to configure it for different repos

## Notes

The user has indicated a plan to use cron jobs in GitHub for automation. This task should explore GitHub Actions' scheduled workflows to achieve this. Consideration should be given to security and access controls for accessing parent and child repositories, possibly using GitHub tokens or SSH keys for authentication.
