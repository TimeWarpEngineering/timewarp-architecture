# Task: 023 = Create Architectural Decision Records

## Description

Create formal Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to document key development workflow decisions that have been made organically over time. This will provide clarity for new team members and preserve the reasoning behind current practices.

## Requirements

- [ ] ADR-0004: Branch naming conventions 
- [ ] ADR-0005: Git merge strategy (merge vs rebase/squash)
- [ ] ADR-0006: Kanban development process (vs Process folder approach)
- [ ] Follow proper MADR format matching existing ADRs
- [ ] Place in `Documentation/Developer/Conceptual/ArchitecturalDecisionRecords/Approved/`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All three ADRs follow the established MADR template format
- [ ] ADRs are numbered sequentially (0004, 0005, 0006)
- [ ] Each ADR includes proper context, considered options, and decision rationale
- [ ] ADRs reference each other where appropriate
- [ ] Content aligns with current repository practices
- [ ] Files are properly placed in the Approved folder

## Implementation Notes

### ADR Topics Covered

**ADR-0004: Branch Naming Conventions**
- Formalizes the `{Author}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{Description}` pattern
- Documents integration with Kanban task numbering
- Provides clear examples and guidelines

**ADR-0005: Git Merge Strategy** 
- Documents preference for merge commits over squash/rebase
- Emphasizes information preservation over presentation aesthetics
- Explains how tooling can handle presentation layer concerns

**ADR-0006: Kanban Development Process**
- Documents choice of Kanban over Process folder approach
- Explains workflow integration with git and branch naming
- Outlines migration plan for Process folder content

### Work Progress

- ✅ Created all three ADR files with proper content
- ✅ Followed MADR format matching repository standards
- ✅ Added proper cross-references between ADRs
- ✅ Used consistent terminology (master vs main branch)
- ⚠️ Need to create proper branch and follow Kanban workflow
- ⚠️ Need to commit changes following proper process

## Related Tasks

- Connects to sync workflow improvements (Task 019-022)
- Foundation for future development process documentation
- Supports onboarding of new team members

## Status

**Current**: Ready to move to proper branch and complete workflow

**Next Steps**:
1. Create branch following naming convention: `Cramer/2025-06-23/Task_023`
2. Move task to InProgress 
3. Commit ADR files on branch
4. Create pull request
5. Move task to Done after merge
