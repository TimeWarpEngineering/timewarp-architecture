## Description

Remove MediatR from the API project since we are using FastEndpoints instead. This is part of the API migration to FastEndpoints architecture.

## Parent

## Requirements

- Remove MediatR package and related dependencies from the API project
- Remove MediatR configurations from startup
- Ensure all MediatR handlers are properly migrated to FastEndpoints
- Update API documentation to reflect the removal of MediatR

## Checklist

### Design
- [ ] Identify all existing MediatR handlers and requests
- [ ] Verify all MediatR functionality has FastEndpoints equivalents

### Implementation
- [ ] Remove MediatR package and dependencies
- [ ] Remove MediatR configurations from Program.cs and other startup files
- [ ] Remove MediatR handlers and requests
- [ ] Verify API functionality after MediatR removal

### Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation to reflect removal of MediatR
- [ ] Remove any MediatR-specific documentation

### Review
- [ ] Consider Accessibility Implications
- [ ] Consider Monitoring and Alerting Implications
- [ ] Consider Performance Implications
- [ ] Consider Security Implications
- [ ] Code Review

## Notes

This task is part of the migration to FastEndpoints architecture. MediatR should only be removed after verifying that all functionality has been properly implemented using FastEndpoints.
