# 022: Update GitIgnore To Support Merge Strategy

## Description

Update the `.gitignore` file in this repository to implement the merge strategy that will be used across all TimeWarpEngineering repositories. This involves restructuring the current `.gitignore` to have distinct global and repository-specific sections with clear markers.

## Parent
021_Add-Sync-Workflow-To-All-TimeWarpEngineering-Repos

## Requirements

- Restructure existing `.gitignore` file with section markers
- Establish this repository as the source of global ignore patterns
- Ensure compatibility with sync workflow deployment strategy
- Maintain all existing ignore functionality

## Checklist

### Implementation
- [ ] Add section markers to current `.gitignore` file
- [ ] Move existing patterns to appropriate sections (global vs. repository-specific)
- [ ] Add documentation comments explaining the merge strategy
- [ ] Test that existing ignore patterns still function correctly
- [ ] Verify no tracked files become untracked due to changes

### Documentation
- [ ] Document the merge strategy in comments within `.gitignore`
- [ ] Update any relevant documentation about the ignore strategy

## Implementation Strategy

### Current State Analysis
The current `.gitignore` contains:
- Standard Visual Studio patterns (lines 1-399)
- Custom TimeWarp Architecture patterns (lines 400+)
- Claude Code settings
- Various project-specific ignores

### Proposed Structure
```gitignore
# ----- Global .gitignore (synced from TimeWarp Architecture) -----
# This section is automatically synced - do not edit manually
# Standard Visual Studio, .NET, Node.js, and development tool patterns
[move most current patterns here]

# ----- Repository-specific .gitignore -----
# Add repository-specific ignore patterns below this line
# TimeWarp Architecture specific patterns
[move architecture-specific patterns here]
```

### Pattern Classification
**Global Patterns (will be synced to other repos):**
- Visual Studio temporary files and build results
- .NET build artifacts (bin/, obj/, etc.)
- Node.js patterns (node_modules/, etc.)
- Common development tools (.vs/, .vscode/, etc.)
- General security patterns (*.pfx, etc.)

**Repository-Specific Patterns:**
- TimeWarp Architecture generated code paths
- Project-specific log files
- Architecture-specific documentation artifacts
- Template-specific ignores
- Kanban task exclusions

## Expected Outcome

A restructured `.gitignore` that:
- Serves as the master template for global patterns
- Demonstrates the merge strategy for other repositories
- Maintains all current ignore functionality
- Provides clear guidance for sync workflow implementation

## Notes

This change prepares the repository to serve as the source for global ignore patterns that will be synced to all other TimeWarpEngineering repositories via the sync workflow.
