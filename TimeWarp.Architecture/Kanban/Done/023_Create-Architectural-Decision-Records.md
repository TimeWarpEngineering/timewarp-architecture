# Task: 023 = Create Architectural Decision Records

## Description

Create formal Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to document key development workflow decisions that have been made organically over time. This will provide clarity for new team members and preserve the reasoning behind current practices.

## Requirements

- [x] ADR-0004: Branch naming conventions 
- [x] ADR-0005: Git merge strategy (merge vs rebase/squash)
- [x] ADR-0006: Kanban development process (vs Process folder approach)
- [x] Follow proper MADR format matching existing ADRs
- [x] Place in `Documentation/Developer/Conceptual/ArchitecturalDecisionRecords/Approved/`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All three ADRs follow the established MADR template format
- [x] ADRs are numbered sequentially (0004, 0005, 0006)
- [x] Each ADR includes proper context, considered options, and decision rationale
- [x] ADRs reference each other where appropriate
- [x] Content aligns with current repository practices
- [x] Files are properly placed in the Approved folder

## Implementation Notes

### ADR Topics Covered

**ADR-0004: Branch Naming Conventions**
- Formalizes the `{Author}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{Description}` pattern
- Documents integration with Kanban task numbering
- Provides clear examples and guidelines

**ADR-0005: Git Merge Strategy** 
- Documents preference for merge commits over squash/rebase
- Emphasizes information preservation over presentation aesthetics
- Explains how tooling can handle presentation layer concerns

**ADR-0006: Kanban Development Process**
- Documents choice of Kanban over Process folder approach
- Explains workflow integration with git and branch naming
- Outlines migration plan for Process folder content
