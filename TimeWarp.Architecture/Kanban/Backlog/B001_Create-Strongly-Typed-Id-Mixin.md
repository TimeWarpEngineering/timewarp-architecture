## Description

Create a strongly typed ID mixin to improve type safety and reduce the risk of using the wrong ID type when interacting with domain entities.

## Requirements
- Use [StronglyTypedId] or [Mixin_StrongTypedId] as the attribute
- Research and review Pete and AndrewLocks' conversation on creating a strongly typed ID mixin.
- Design and implement a mixin that can be used to create strongly typed IDs for various domain entities.
- Update relevant domain entities to use the new strongly typed ID mixin.
- Ensure that the new mixin integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.

## Notes

- The goal of this task is to improve type safety when working with domain entities by using a strongly typed ID mixin.
- Consider any implications on performance, security, and maintainability while implementing the mixin.

## Implementation Notes

- You may need to update the domain entities to use the new mixin.
- Ensure that the mixin is easy to use and understand.
