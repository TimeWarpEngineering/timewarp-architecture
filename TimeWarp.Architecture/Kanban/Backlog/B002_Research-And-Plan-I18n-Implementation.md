# Research and Plan i18n Implementation

## Description

Research and create a comprehensive plan for implementing internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) support in the TimeWarp.Architecture template. This includes analyzing existing .NET i18n solutions, evaluating integration approaches with Blazor WebAssembly/Server, and defining the architecture for multi-language support.

## Requirements

- Research current .NET i18n best practices and available libraries
- Evaluate compatibility with Blazor WebAssembly and Server modes
- Analyze integration requirements with TimeWarp State management
- Define resource management strategy (RESX, JSON, database, etc.)
- Consider pluralization and cultural formatting requirements
- Plan for runtime language switching capability
- Assess impact on FastEndpoints API responses
- Define localization workflow for development teams

## Checklist

### Research
- [ ] Research .NET Core i18n libraries and frameworks
- [ ] Evaluate Blazor-specific localization solutions
- [ ] Analyze community solutions and best practices
- [ ] Review Microsoft's official i18n guidance for Blazor

### Design
- [ ] Design resource management architecture
- [ ] Plan integration with TimeWarp State management
- [ ] Define API contract localization strategy
- [ ] Design language switching user experience
- [ ] Plan fallback language handling

### Implementation Planning
- [ ] Define file organization structure for localized resources
- [ ] Plan configuration management for supported languages
- [ ] Design developer workflow for adding new translations
- [ ] Plan testing strategy for localized content

### Documentation
- [ ] Create implementation roadmap
- [ ] Document architectural decisions
- [ ] Create developer guide outline

## Notes

This is a research and planning task. The goal is to create a comprehensive implementation plan that can be broken down into specific development tasks. Consider the distributed microservices architecture and ensure the i18n solution works across all container applications (Web, Api, Grpc, Yarp).

Key considerations:
- TimeWarp State management integration
- FastEndpoints API localization
- Blazor WebAssembly vs Server mode differences
- Development workflow efficiency
- Performance impact on application startup and runtime
