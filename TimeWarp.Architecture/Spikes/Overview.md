# Spike Folder

This folder is intended to hold small experiments or "spikes" that explore new ideas or test assumptions.
The purpose of these spikes is to help us identify potential issues or roadblocks early on,
before we invest significant time and resources into a new feature or approach.

We encourage everyone on the team to contribute to this folder and to share their results and insights.
By working together and sharing our knowledge, we can drive innovation and progress in our development work.

Some tips for managing your Spike folder might include:

- Keeping good notes and documentation of your experiments
- Sharing your results with the team
- Being willing to iterate and adapt as you learn more

Remember, the goal of this folder is to encourage experimentation and to help us learn and grow as developers.
So don't be afraid to take risks and try out new things!

Feel free to update this Readme.md file as needed to reflect the evolving purpose and usage of the Spike folder. Good luck and have fun experimenting!
