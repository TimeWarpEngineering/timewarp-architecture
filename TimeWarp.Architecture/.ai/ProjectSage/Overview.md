Input:  Currently the human is the only input no artifcat.
Output: The artifacts coming out of the ProjectSage are Epics in the Kanban Folders

TODO: Update this doc to define what should be in an "Epic Brief"


From Perplexity below:

The most appropriate artifact from ProductSage to TaskSage would be an **Epic Brief**, which serves as the structured handoff document.

## Epic Brief Components

**Vision Statement**
- Clear description of the feature or product increment
- Business value and expected outcomes
- Target user personas and their needs

**Success Criteria**
- Measurable objectives
- Key performance indicators
- Acceptance criteria at the epic level

**Scope Definition**
- High-level feature boundaries
- Major functional components
- Integration points with existing systems

**Dependencies**
- System constraints
- External service requirements
- Technical prerequisites

**User Journey Maps**
- Key user interactions
- Primary user flows
- Critical path scenarios

This Epic Brief provides TaskSage with sufficient context and boundaries to break down the work into detailed, actionable Kanban tasks while ensuring alignment with the product vision and architectural guidelines.

## Handoff Process
ProductSage would create the Epic Brief as a structured document that TaskSage can systematically process to generate granular tasks that align with both the product vision and technical constraints defined by the Architect.
