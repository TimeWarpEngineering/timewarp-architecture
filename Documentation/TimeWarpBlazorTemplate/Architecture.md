Everything is subjective:

The primary goal of an architecture is to maximize the effeciency of producing impactful software.

Lets try and break this down:

Impactful software
: Software that has a significant effect in accomplishing a business/personal goal.  
 
The software isn't the goal but a means to a goal. 

Functional software
: Software that correctly produces an expect output given a set of inputs. As an example a sort function given a list of unsorted items will return a sorted list.

Quality software

: Software that has low to zero defects.

* Effciency 
* Quality
* Functional
* Force Multiplier
* Flexability

Does quality matter?

What is quality?  

> "When software is done right, ... Changes are simple and rapid. Defects are few and far between. Effort is minimized, and functionality and flexibility are maximized.

Quality is NOT the goal impa
  
##  "Changes are simple and rapid."  

Actor: Existing Dev or new Dev:
Test Case: Given a change request 
So what would be test case for this


Clean Architecture is primarily about decoupling.  TimeWarp architecture is also about decoupling but more.

TimeWarp Documentation is about building and rebuilding the mental model required to accomplish a given task as quickly as possible.

TimeWarp Mentoring is about Empowering developers to bring their current and future visions into reality.

Developer Documentation UX (DevDocX) is about transfering clarity and understanding of the holositc view and concepts so that a developer can travase their chosen path with maximum effeciency to realize their given goal.  Effeciency implies reducing the time being spent on things not needed for their goal. And also transfering of information as rapidly as possible for those things needed for their goal.

Example based docs
Live Notebooks

Practice based lessons.


There are multiple concepts at play here:
1. Teaching.  Building the mental model the first time.
2. Recall. Recalling what you learned before.
3. Discovery/Expansion: Expanding on the concepts to create new ones.
